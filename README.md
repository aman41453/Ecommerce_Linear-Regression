# Ecommerce_Linear-Regression
"In this e-commerce project utilizing Python, I implemented linear regression to analyze and predict sales trends based on various factors like advertising spend, website traffic, and promotional activities. Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, I processed and cleaned the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis to uncover correlations, and built a linear regression model. The project aimed to optimize marketing strategies by predicting sales performance and identifying influential variables. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed to present insights effectively, enhancing decision-making capabilities for maximizing revenue in the competitive e-commerce landscape."
